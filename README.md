# Sentiment-Analysis
This repository contains the code, instructions and other information about a project that uses basic elements of data processing to analyse public sentiment through tweets.

Through crawling the web and scraping tweets from two popular politcians during elections, and analysing the text, the public sentiment can be determined. 

This project is made using Gradio for data representation and basic python libraries such as nltk, textblob, pandas, numpy etc. The goal of this project was to gain a deeper and more practical insight on how web scraping is carried out, and how to use supervised learning for classification. Through this, I gained a deeper understanding of data extraction, and processing, whilst learning a new framework such as Gradio to present my model.
